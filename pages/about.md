## About the Collection

Historical views of the Welland Canal as well as views of construction projects including some plans and statistics.  Most of the slides are comprised of 2 pieces of glass held together by tape. In some cases, the tape has been replaced and it is noted that a couple of the slides are only made up of one piece of glass. Some of the slides are damaged â€“ this is noted in the descriptions. There is some speckling which occurs within the pieces of glass.
